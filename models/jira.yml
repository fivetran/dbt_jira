    description: >
      Each record represents a snapshot of an issue's selected fields (as specified in
      the `issue_history_columns` variable + sprint and status by default) on a given day.
      Each issue will have a record for every day in which it was open and/or being updated. 
      For currently open issues, the latest date will be the current date, and for closed issues,
      this will be the last time the issue was resolved OR updated in any way (plus a configurable buffer afterward,
      set to a month by default).
      Note: this is an incremental model.
