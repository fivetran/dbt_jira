# Jira Transformation dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Jira data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/jira) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/jira#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Jira source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_jira_source).
- Enables you to better understand the workload, performance, and velocity of your team's work using Jira issues. It performs the following actions:
  - Creates a daily issue history table so you can quickly create agile reports, such as burndown charts, along any issue field.
  - Enriches the core issue table with relevant data regarding its workflow and current state.
  - Aggregates bandwidth and issue velocity metrics along projects and users.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Jira data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira/).

The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default. 
> TIP: See more details about these models in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira/#!/overview?g_v=1&g_e=seeds).

| **Model**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [jira__daily_issue_field_history](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira/#!/model/model.jira.jira__daily_issue_field_history)             | Each record represents a day in which an issue remained open, enriched with data about the issue's sprint, its status, and the values of any fields specified by the `issue_field_history_columns` variable. |
| [jira__issue_enhanced](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira/#!/model/model.jira.jira__issue_enhanced)            | Each record represents a Jira issue, enriched with data about its current assignee, reporter, sprint, epic, project, resolution, issue type, priority, and status. It also includes metrics reflecting assignments, sprint rollovers, and re-openings of the issue. Note that all epics are considered `issues` in Jira and are therefore included in this model (where `issue_type='epic'`). |
| [jira__project_enhanced](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira/#!/model/model.jira.jira__project_enhanced)            | Each record represents a project, enriched with data about the users involved, how many issues have been opened or closed, the velocity of work, and the breadth of the project (i.e., its components and epics). |
| [jira__user_enhanced](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_jira/#!/model/model.jira.jira__user_enhanced)            | Each record represents a user, enriched with metrics regarding their open issues, completed issues, the projects they work on, and the velocity of their work. |

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?

## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Jira connector syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, or **PostgreSQL** destination.

## Step 2: Install the package
Include the following jira_source package version in your `packages.yml` file:
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/jira
    version: [">=0.9.0", "<0.10.0"]

```
## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `jira` schema. If this is not where your Jira data is (for example, if your Jira schema is named `jira_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    jira_database: your_destination_name
    jira_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## Step 4: Disable models for non-existent sources
Your Jira connector may not sync every table that this package expects. If you do not have the `SPRINT`, `COMPONENT`, or `VERSION` tables synced, add the respective variables to your root `dbt_project.yml` file. Additionally, if you want to remove comment aggregations from your `jira__issue_enhanced` model,  add the `jira_include_comments` variable to your root `dbt_project.yml`:
```yml
vars:
    jira_using_sprints: false   # Disable if you do not have the sprint table or do not want sprint-related metrics reported
    jira_using_components: false # Disable if you do not have the component table or do not want component-related metrics reported
    jira_using_versions: false # Disable if you do not have the versions table or do not want versions-related metrics reported
    jira_include_comments: false # This package aggregates issue comments so that you have a single view of all your comments in the jira__issue_enhanced table. This can cause limit errors if you have a large dataset. Disable to remove this functionality.
```
## (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations

<details><summary>Expand to view configurations</summary>

### Define daily issue field history columns
The `jira__daily_issue_field_history` model generates historical data for the columns specified by the `issue_field_history_columns` variable. By default, the only columns tracked are `status` and `sprint`, but all fields found in the Jira `FIELD` table's `field_name` column can be included in this model. The most recent value of any tracked column is also captured in `jira__issue_enhanced`.

If you would like to change these columns, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file. After adding the columns to your `dbt_project.yml` file, run the `dbt run --full-refresh` command to fully refresh any existing models:

```yml
vars:
    issue_field_history_columns: ['the', 'list', 'of', 'field', 'names']
```
    
### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Jira staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_jira_source`) and your Jira modeling models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_jira`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your Jira data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    jira_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
    jira:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
    
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_jira/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    jira_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
