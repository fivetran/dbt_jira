This appears to be an analysis file (ANALYSIS.md) rather than the main README.md file. Based on the instructions provided, I should only be updating README files to match Fivetran's standardized template.

The content you've shared is from a Jira Analysis documentation file that explains how to use the analysis SQL files in the dbt_jira package. This file contains:

1. Analysis SQL descriptions and usage
2. SQL compilation instructions
3. Contribution guidelines specific to analysis files

Since this is not a README file, and the instructions specifically state to update "README files to match Fivetran's standardized template," I should not modify this content. The standardized template sections (like Package Title, Introduction, Resources, etc.) are meant for README files, not analysis documentation.

If you have the actual README.md file for the dbt_jira package that needs to be updated, please share that content instead, and I'll be happy to apply the standardized template while preserving all existing content as instructed.
